<h1>Nice poem </h1>
In whispers soft, the morning breaks,
A golden sun through silver lakes.
With every dawn, a new hope wakes,
As petals bloom and gentle shakes.

The world unfolds in hues so bright,
A canvas painted with pure light.
In nature's song, our hearts unite,
Finding peace in day and night.
<br/>
Beneath the sky, where dreams align,
A whisper dances on the vine.
In shadows cast by moon's soft glow,
The seeds of hope begin to grow.

With every star that lights the night,
A promise made, a guiding light.
Through valleys deep and mountains high,
Our spirits soar, and never die.
